                <p class="basic__txt">Although Kyushu is usually warm and comfortable throughout the year, it still
                    has days of rain or sometimes snow depending on the season, so it is important to choose your
                    clothes according to the season when you visit. There is often a large temperature difference
                    between morning and night, so it is recommended to layer your clothes so that you can easily put
                    on and take off extra clothes.
                    It is also advisable to check up on minimum manners and etiquette required in Japan before
                    coming to Japan, to enjoy cultural experiences and shopping.</p>
