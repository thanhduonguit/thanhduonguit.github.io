                    <p>Recently, Japanese ramen has been gaining popularity all around the world, almost reaching the level
                        of popularity earned by sushi. Ramen has a wide variety of soups, noodles, and ingredients,
                        including tonkotsu (pork bone) soup, shoyu (soy sauce) soup, miso soup, and original noodles. There
                        are numerous kinds of local ramen all over Japan. Among others, tonkotsu ramen has been gaining fans
                        around the world, as a “hot” Japanese dish. Kyushu is the birthplace of tonkotsu ramen and the “holy
                        ground of tonkotsu,” with its deeply-rooted tonkotsu ramen culture. This article will start with
                        introducing the history of the origin and spread of Kyushu Ramen.</p>
                    <p>Tonkotsu ramen, which is taking the world by storm, was born in Kyushu</p>
                    <p>Kyushu Ramen is a collective term for local noodles in Kyushu, including Hakata Ramen and Kumamoto
                        Ramen. Although thickness of the noodles and ingredients may vary, the soup, which is the base of
                        the dish, is uniformly white, cloudy tonkotsu soup. When talking about Kyushu Ramen, one must
                        mention Kurume City (Fukuoka Prefecture) which is said to be the birthplace of tonkotsu ramen.</p>
                    <p>Tonkotsu ramen was first created at Nankinsenryo, a street-side vendor selling ramen
                        on Meiji-dori Street in Kurume City in 1937. The first owner, who used to run an udon noodles shop, created
                        tonkotsu ramen based on the combination of “shina-soba” (shoyu ramen), which was popular at the time
                        in Tokyo and Yokohama, and “champon” noodles, which is the local specialty of his own hometown,
                        Nagasaki. At that time, although Chinese restaurants offered noodles in soup, the soup was made from
                        chicken bones. It is said that the owner decided to use pork bone, as it was cheaper than chicken
                        bones.</p>

                <div class="section__img--2">

                            <p class="mt__10">One of the oldest ramen shops, Raifukuken, is shown in the photo above. You can
                                see that ramen used to be called “chuka-soba”(Chinese noodles) rather than ramen.</p>

                <div class="section__text--2">
                    <p>However, the first ramen noodles created at Nankinsenryo were different from the typical tonkotsu
                        ramen we see nowadays. The soup used to be somewhat clear.</p>
                    <p>So, how and when was the white, cloudy soup born? It was at Sankyu in Kurume City,
                        which started up
                        in 1947, 10 years after Nankinsenryo created the tonkotsu ramen.</p>
                    <p>One day, when the owner went out, tonkotsu soup was simmering on the stove. The soup
                        got so boiled
                        that it became white and cloudy. He seasoned it, tried it, and found it was very delicious. In this
                        way, white, cloudy tonkotsu soup was born by accident.</p>
                    <p class="info__title">From Kurume to all over Kyushu</p>
                    <p>Sankyu, who created the white, cloudy tonkotsu soup, later opened branches in Saga City (Saga
                        Prefecture) and Tamana City (Kumamoto Prefecture). The founders of famous ramen shops, including
                        Keika, Komurasaki, Ajisen Ramen, and Shoyoken, visited the Tamana branch of Sankyu to learn the
                        taste of the new tonkotsu soup and later opened their own shops of tonkotsu ramen in Kumamoto City,
                        creating a new type, Kumamoto Ramen, which is characterized by deep-fried garlic chips. In addition,
                        Miyazaki Ramen also traces its origin to Kurume.</p>
                    <p>As described above, tonkotsu ramen, which was born in Kurume, spread all over Kyushu
                        in
                        a radial fashion and developed as original ramen in each area. Another contributor to the prevalence
                        of tonkotsu ramen is long-distance truck drivers. They spread the reputation of tonkotsu ramen all
                        over Japan. Recently, ramen shops from Fukuoka extended their business not only to other areas
                        across the country but also all over the world, further enhancing its popularity.</p>
                    <p class="mt__10">Nankinsenryo in Kurume City (Fukuoka Prefecture), the birthplace of Kyushu Ramen, is
                        still in business and is now celebrating its 80th anniversary in 2017. In this milestone year, enjoy
